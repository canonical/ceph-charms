# shim used to determine that the ceph packages have been installed
# before running hook execution. The add-storage hook fires before
# the install hook in order to provide storage for charms which need
# it at install time, however the storage added for the ceph-osd
# application will be used to create OSDs, which require the ceph
# binaries, bootstrapping the node, etc.
#
# Note: this doesn't wait to ensure that ceph is bootstrapped because
# that logic is already existing in the charm's hook.
